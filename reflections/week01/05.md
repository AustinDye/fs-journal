# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

This week has solidified the fundumentals of HTML into my mind, along with learning how ot actually use bootstrap and create project frameworks. I am excited to work with programming languages that let me do some math!

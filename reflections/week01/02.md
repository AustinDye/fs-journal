## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

psudo classes specify a state for a selector. I would imagine :hover would be used quite a bit.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

The order in which selectors are prioritized. We can use it to avoid conflicting values on selectors.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature? 

The selectors with the !important tag could conflict with each other. It is also considered bad practice

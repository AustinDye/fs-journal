## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
   a row is a complete object, while the column is an index for objects

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE characters(
name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
age int,
description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
id int NOT NULL,
);

3. What are the difference between the following statements:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

delete will remove na item from a table, drop will trash the entire table

# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This week has been very hard, I have been giving it my all but being sick is slowing me down a lot. It's sunday night and I've been grinding just to barely pass the checkpoint. This next week will be a lot better, I'm finally feeling a lot better today.

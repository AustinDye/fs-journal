## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

where the variables are available for use 

2. What is Hoisting ?
    JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

var is globally scoped(and yucky due to hoisting), let is block scoped,  const is also block scoped but with the addition of not being able to be modified after declerartion. That being said we never use var, primarily use let, and use const for any unchanging variables

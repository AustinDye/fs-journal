## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
   it allows us to pass properties that are repeated in our classes down to other classes that use the same proprties. This saves us time and allows our code to be more re-usable.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
   Classes inherit members of the previous class, except for the first of course. The class passes down members that it inhereted from the previous class, that could possibly be changed, with the class after inherting those changes.
